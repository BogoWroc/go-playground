			Whenever he felt able he ran again; the ground continued soft and springy, covered with the same resilient weed which was
			the first thing his hands had touched in Malacandra. Once or twice a small red creature scuttled across his path, but otherwise
			there seemed to be no life stirring in the wood; nothing to fearâ€”except the fact of wandering unprovisioned and alone in a
			forest of unknown vegetation thousands or millions of miles beyond the reach or knowledge of man.`
